Objective:-

1. Write bootstrap code to illustrate the central limit theorem in R markdown and push the result to GitHub. 
2. Use a normal distribution with two different sample sizes and an exponential distribution with two different sample sizes.
3. Correct code alone is insufficient. Please also comment on the code and explain the results. 
4. For help, see the lotsa.medians function in unit 2. 
5. The deliverable is a link to a GitHub repo containing the code.

## Central Limit Theorem 

The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean of any independent, random variable will be normal or nearly normal, if the sample size is large enough.
